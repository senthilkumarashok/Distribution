# Distribution

## Bionomial Distribution

Probability of getting P(x) in n trails = nCx * (p ^ x) * (q ^ (n-x))

Number of Combinations = nCr = n! / ( (n-r)! * r! )

## Poisson Distribution

Probability of getting P(X = x) = (Mean ^ x) ( e ^ -Mean ) / x! 

For example x = 8, mean = 12 => (12 ^ 8) (e ^ -12) / 8!
